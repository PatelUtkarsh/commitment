“Don't stop chasing your dreams, because dreams do come true.” ­Sachin Tendulkar
Think big, think fast, think ahead. Ideas are no one’s monopoly.
Our dreams have to be bigger. Our ambitions higher. Our commitment deeper. And our efforts greater.

It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.

You're Beautiful.
